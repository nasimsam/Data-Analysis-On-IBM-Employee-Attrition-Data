The objective of this project is to identify key factors that contribute to employees staying longer with the organization. To achieve this, I analyzed various factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, employee-manager relationships, and performance ratings. To prepare the data for analysis, I performed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and utilized Pandas dataframes for data manipulation. Finally, I employed various visualization techniques, including line plots, line charts, histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts, to gain valuable insights from the data. These insights can inform strategies to improve employee retention and enhance the overall work environment.
